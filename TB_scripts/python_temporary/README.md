## Description
a) Usage of this code

This code is important to further analyse the data which was generated by run_30 from AFNI. To analyse your data with this code, you have to copy the netcc files which were generated via run_30 and change them into textfiles. You can do that while exchanging '.netcc' with '.txt'. Then you have to change the variables 'file_predrug' and 'file_postdrug' with the names of your files. In these files you can find the correlation data which was used to generate the correlation matrices by AFNI. The exact data being used was 'CC' which is also used in these python scripts. To visualize how I set the variables, please refer to 'c) Supplementary information'. I was able to generalize the analysis because the netcc files have always a similar organization. The difference between all netcc files is the number of ROIs which are stated in the first line of the files. In this code, the code will extract this number and computes out of that the borders of every comparison (CL-CL, CR-CR and CR-CL). CR is here the right hemispere and CL the left hemispere.

b) Data

The data used with these scripts is from the German Primate Center (DAG, Pinocchio/Linus). They are resting state recordings of anesthetized monkeys that were separated into two sessions (predrug and postdrug). A drug was applied to inhibit the resting state activity of the pulvinar in the right hemisphere.

c) Supplementary informations

In the following correlation matrix you can see how I declinated the variables. The data in the file which is analysed with the python scripts is organized like a correlation matrix. With this code is only the data under the pink line used (left triangle).

## Installation
a) General Instructions

You can let this code run in jupyter notebook with the specific button.

b) Changing the files

You have to change the netcc files into textfiles by changing the '.netcc' into '.txt'.

c) Changing the variables

You have to change the variables 'file_predrug' and 'file_postdrug' with the names of your files.
Example: file_predrug = "MYFILESNAME.txt"  --> file_predrug = "YOURFILENAME.txt"

Make sure that your files have a differnet name.
