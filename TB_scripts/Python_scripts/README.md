## Description
a) **Usage of this code**

This code is important for further analysing the data generated by run_30 from AFNI. To analyse your data with this code, you have to copy the .netcc files generated by run_30 and convert them into text files. You can do that by changing the file extension from '.netcc' to '.txt'. Then, you need to modify the variables 'file_predrug' and 'file_postdrug' to match the names of your files. These files contain the correlation data used to generate the correlation matrices in AFNI. The exact data being used was 'CC' which is also used in these python scripts. To visualize how I set the variables, please refer to 'c) Supplementary information'. I was able to generalize the analysis because the netcc files always follow a similar structure. The only difference between all netcc files is the number of ROIs, which are stated in the first line of each file. This code extracts that number and computes out of that the borders for each comparison (CL-CL, CR-CR and CR-CL). Here,  CR refers to the right hemisphere and CL refers to the left hemisphere.

b) **Data**

The data used with these scripts is from the German Primate Center (DAG, Pinocchio/Linus). They are resting state recordings of anesthetized monkeys that were separated into two sessions (predrug and postdrug). A drug was applied to inhibit the resting state activity of the pulvinar in the right hemisphere.

c) **Supplementary informations**

In the following correlation matrix, you can see how I set the variables. The data in the file analysed by the Python scripts is organized like a correlation matrix. The code uses only the data bellow the pink line (left triangle).

## Installation
a) **General Instructions**

You can let this code run in jupyter notebook with the specific button.

b) **Changing the files**

You need to change the netcc files into text files by renaming the extension from '.netcc' to '.txt'.

c) **Changing the variables**

You need to modify the variables 'file_predrug' and 'file_postdrug' with the names of your files.
Example: 

file_predrug = "MYFILESNAME.txt"  â†’ file_predrug = "YOURFILENAME.txt"

Make sure that your files have different names.
