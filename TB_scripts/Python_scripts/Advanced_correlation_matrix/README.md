# Code for generating an averaged correlation matrix, standard deviation matrix, line plots, and statistical tests

## Description

**a) Usage of this script**

This script contains several functions. First, it calculates and visualizes the average correlation values across all monkeys in a correlation matrix. It also computes and visualizes the standard deviation of these values. Using the averaged correlation values, the script then demonstrates the pulvino-cortical correlation values in a line plot, both with and without standard deviation. Additionally, statistical tests such as Pearson's correlation and the Friedman test are performed.

The errors appearing in the code are due to the fact that this script was manually edited for this GitHub repository and has not been actively used.

**b) Data**

The data used with these scripts is from the German Primate Center (DAG, Pinocchio/Linus/Rio/Norman/Curius). They are resting state recordings of anesthetized monkeys that were in one monkeys datatset separated into two sessions (predrug and postdrug). A drug was applied to inhibit the resting state activity of the pulvinar in the left hemisphere.

**c) Supplementary informations**

These codes are created to be executed from jupyter notebook.
