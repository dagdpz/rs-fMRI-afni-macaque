# Code for generating boxplot diagrams

## Description

**a) Usage of this script**

In this directory are two different scripts, which have the same purpose: To create one or more boxplot diagrams for our data we received from the MRI. 
They both contain variables in the top of ech code which should be filled out to secure correct results afterwards. The code will take the content of the variables and use them to create a diagram automatically. This procedure saves time and reduces errors. 

The code 'boxplot.ipynb' is creating boxplot diagrams for one hemisphere either with the postdrug or predrug data.

The code 'boxplot_with_seperate_comparison_prepostdrug.ipynb' has an extra feature which creates a boxplotdiagram, comparing results within one hemisphere for both pre and postdrug data.

The code 'boxplot_new.ipynb' is similar to 'boxplot.ipynb', but it contains the final boxplots along with the statistical tests used in my thesis.

**b) Data**

The data used with these scripts is from the German Primate Center (DAG, Pinocchio/Linus/Rio/Norman/Curius). They are resting state recordings of anesthetized monkeys that were in one dataset of one monkey separated into two sessions (predrug and postdrug). A drug was applied to inhibit the resting state activity of the pulvinar in the left hemisphere.

**c) Supplementary informations**

These codes are created to be executed from jupyter notebook.
