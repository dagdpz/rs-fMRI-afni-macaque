# Code for generating scatter plot

## Description

**a) Usage of this script**

This code is generated to create a scatter plot, comparing the correlation values before and after drug injection in the right and left hemispheres. A trend line is added for both datasets, as well as an identity line. With this diagram, the dataset can be verified. The data is filtered to include only values that are above 0.2 predrug and that do not equal one.

**b) Data**

The data used with these scripts is from the German Primate Center (DAG, Pinocchio/Linus). They are resting state recordings of anesthetized monkeys that were separated into two sessions (predrug and postdrug). A drug was applied to inhibit the resting state activity of the pulvinar in the left hemisphere.

**c) Supplementary informations**

These codes are created to be executed from jupyter notebook.
