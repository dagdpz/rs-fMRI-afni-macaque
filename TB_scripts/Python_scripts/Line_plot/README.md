# Code for generating line plots and conducting statistical tests

## Description

**a) Usage of this script**

In this directory, there is a script that creates a line plot comparing the mean values of different types of brain connections in monkeys. Specifically, it compares the mean values of:
a) intrahemispheric vs. interhemispheric correlations,
b) intrahemispheric vs. homotopic correlations, and
c) intrahemispheric vs. heterotopic correlations.

Subsequently, statistical tests are conducted, including a Friedman test and a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Additionally, separate diagrams are generated to compare the same connection types between two monkeys (L1 and L2).

**b) Data**

The data used with these scripts is from the German Primate Center (DAG, Pinocchio/Linus/Rio/Norman/Curius). They are resting state recordings of anesthetized monkeys that were in one monkeys datatset separated into two sessions (predrug and postdrug). A drug was applied to inhibit the resting state activity of the pulvinar in the left hemisphere.

**c) Supplementary informations**

These codes are created to be executed from jupyter notebook.
