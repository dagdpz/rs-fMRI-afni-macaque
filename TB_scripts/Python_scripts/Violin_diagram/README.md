# Code for generating violin diagrams

## Description

**a) Usage of this script**

In this directory, there are two scripts which were generated to create violin plots. To this end, variables are declined on the top of each code, which save the accurately of the results and avoid making errors. 

The code 'violin_diagrams_with_preconditions.ipynb' is generating a violin diagram for one hemisophere for one session (either predrug or postdrug).

The code 'violin_diagrams_with_preconditions_seperate_comparison_prepostdrug.ipynb' is creating a diagram for one hemisphere both for the predrug and postdrug data within one diagram.

**b) Data**

The data used with these scripts is from the German Primate Center (DAG, Pinocchio/Linus). They are resting state recordings of anesthetized monkeys that were separated into two sessions (predrug and postdrug). A drug was applied to inhibit the resting state activity of the pulvinar in the left hemisphere.

**c) Supplementary informations**

These codes are created to be executed from jupyter notebook.
