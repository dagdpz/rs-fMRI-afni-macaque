# **TB_scripts**
In this folder you can find all scripts which were created by Tabea Bruening during her work for her bachelor thesis. The scripts in general are converting DICOM data into the BIDS structure and analyse the data. Every folder contains specific README files which are describing the usage of the scripts/instructions for the installation/examples and a lot more details.
The following section 'script-organization' provides general informations about every folder, its containing scripts and the differences. If you would like to run specific scripts, you can just go into the folder and read the instructions in the README file there.

**To successfully process MRI data, follow these steps:**

*Convert DICOM to BIDS format:*
Use the TB_scripts_dcm2bids to convert your DICOM files into the standard BIDS structure (including conversion to NIfTI format).
Further details about how these scripts work can be found in section c).

*Prepare the analysis directory:*
Create a new directory containing:

- The BIDS-formatted DICOM files

- The analysis scripts (see sections a, b, and c)

- The NMT template

*Run the analysis scripts:*
Execute the scripts from within this directory (see sections a, b, and c for details).
The scripts will generate several intermediate outputs, such as the skull-stripped MRI images.

*Final output:*
The last generated file (as described in a, b, and c) contains the analyzed data â€” including time series and correlation matrices comparing brain regions at six different resolutions.

*Further analysis:*
The Python scripts (see g) can be used to further analyze the correlation patterns generated in the previous steps.

## **script-organization**

a) **TB_scripts_analysing**

* Contains scripts for analysing BIDS data
* Scripts for 3mm smoothing, without smoothing and for individual runs
* Each run\_all.tcsh script provides commands for the user to insert names or to copy a folder into the directory
* This run\_all script will do both, voxel-based and ROI-based analysis

b) **TB_scripts_analysing_wnewrunall**

* Contains scripts for analysing BIDS data
* Scripts for 3mm smoothing, without smoothing and for individual runs
* Each run\_all.tcsh script provides commands for the user to insert names or to copy a folder into the directory
* Difference to run\_all.tcsh scripts from TB\_scripts_analysing : User can choose if he/she wants the script to carry out a voxel-based, ROI-based or both types of analysis

c) **TB_scripts_analysing_runall_withbreak**

* Contains scripts for analysing BIDS data
* Scripts for 3mm smoothing, without smoothing and for individual runs
* Each run\_all.tcsh script provides commands for the user to insert names or to copy a folder into the directory
* User can choose if he/she wants the script to carry out a voxel-based, ROI-based or both types of analysis
* Difference to TB\_scripts\_analysing\_wneweunall : I implemented a break between run\_13_aw.tcsh and following analysing scripts in which user is asked to check the results from the skull stripping. The exact name of the file which should be checked and the way to it is provided. The user can confirm it with a keyboard shortcut or they can abort the script.
  
d) **TB_scripts_dcm2bids**

* Contains script which converts DICOM data into BIDS structure
* Provides commands for user to insert names
  
e) **TB_scripts_dcm2bids_preandpostdrug_2config**

* Contains script which converts DICOM data into BIDS structure
* Provides commands for user to insert names
* Difference to TB_scripts_dm2bids: script supposes that you have two configuration files with two different sessions and folders in which this data is

f) **TB_scripts_dcm2bids_converting_analysing**

* Contains script which converts DICOM data into BIDS structure
* Provides commands for user to insert names
* Difference to TB\_scripts\_dcm2bids and TB\_scripts\_dcm2bids\_preandpostdrug\_2config: user can decide via standard input if script should continue with analysis (start run_all)

g) **Python_scripts**

* contains script which analyse the data of run_30 further

h) **Other_codes**

* contains other scripts, I generated and used for the thesis work
